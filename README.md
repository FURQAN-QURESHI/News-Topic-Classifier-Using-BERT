Objective
Fine-tune a BERT-based transformer model to classify news headlines into categories using the AG News dataset. Deploy the model as an interactive web app (Streamlit/Gradio).

Workflow
Dataset: AG News

Preprocessing: Tokenization, padding, and encoding using Hugging Face tokenizer.

Model: bert-base-uncased fine-tuned for 4-class classification.

Training: Hugging Face Trainer API.

Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score.

Deployment: Streamlit/Gradio web interface for headline classification.
